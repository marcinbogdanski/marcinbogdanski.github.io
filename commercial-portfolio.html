The project was to build a proof-of-concept vision system to detect and recognise a signs from mobile phone and deliver verdict to user whether they can park at the location.</p><p><b>Technology:</b> The system uses customised state-of-the-art multi-stage neural network for detection.  The main challenge was working with tiny data set and large variety of backgrounds, lighting and weather conditions and obstructions. System was deployed for production on Amazon EC2</p><div><div style='width:80%; float:left'>This project won <b>first place</b> and monetary <b>prize $20,000</b> at the Melbourne Knowledge Week.

Combining sensor data form thousands of properties we were able to identify actionable insights for occupants and landlords.</p><p><b>Technology:</b><br />Houses were equipped with variety of sensors like power, temperature, humidity, CO2. We used variety of models like ARIMA, Gaussian processes, neural networks to detect latent variables (e.g. occupancy status), predict behavioural patterns (e.g. heating requirements) and risk of issues (e.g. hidden mould).</p>"

I provided know-how via ongoing consulting as well as developed actual software for data pre-processing and model training and testing. The customer provided images and preliminary labels in a raw format. Large part of the project was to browse, clean, select and label data provided so it can be feed into machine learning component.</p><p><b>Technology:</b><br/> Due to unique technical challenges encountered, two non-standard components were developed: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) a completely custom pre-processing pipeline to deal characteristics of input data <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) far-going optimisation of neural network subsystem to allow for fast training time.</p>"

Robot would navigate over GPS over predetermined routes, where obstacle avoidance module would be responsible for detecting unexpected obstacles like pedestrians, parked vehicles and similar (robot would use walking paths).</p><p><b>Technology:</b> Primary sensor was front facing monocular RGB camera (aka webcam). Images from camera were processed by two independent neural networks: 1) <b>YOLO</b> for object detection and localisation - pedestrians, parked vehicles etc. Network was trained on both pre-existing dataset as well as mix-in of our own training data. 2) <b>SegNet</b> for detecting if ground in front of vehicle is derivable (pavement, tarmac). Network was pre-trained on CityScapes with few added images.</p>"

Tool bits wear down and technicians often forget to check and replace them. This system automatically takes picture of tool bit before job is started and feeds it into convolutional neural network to classify current wear of the tool bit.</p><p><b>Technology:</b> Image classification is performed with DenseNet-201 which showed best performance out of tried architectures. CNN was pre-trained on ImageNet and trained any further. Classifier was trained on target dataset with heavy data augmentation and regularisation applied. After training network was able to detect cracked, chirped or overheated (changed color) tool bits.</p><p>System is operating in a machine shop at the aerospace manufacturing facility.</p>'

Swarm would start in containers, then deploy solar panels, build surface base, excavate tunnels, process raw materials and finally wind up operation. The complexity of the project was similar to simple strategy video game.</p><p><b>Technology:</b> Simulation is physics-based, build in Unity3D game engine along with set of plugins for dynamic volumetric terrain (so robots can freely excavate). Individual robot AI manages energy, navigation, task queues etc. Swarm AI manages task allocation, robot coordination, excavation orders and similar.</p><p>At any point user can override high-level strategy or take over full control over individual robot.</p>"
